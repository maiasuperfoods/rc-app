# Canela webfont files

Canela (Commercial Type) is the primary headline face of the Renaissance Commerce font system.
Its font files are deliberately not committed to this repo. The CSS in `src/app/globals.css` loads:

- `Canela-LightItalic.woff2` — display headlines (weight 300, italic)
- `Canela-Light.woff2` — decorative Roman numerals only (weight 300, upright)

from this folder. Until both files are here, headline letters fall back to Georgia italic for anyone
who does not have Canela installed on their own machine.
